# Hangman-CSharp
Basic Hangman game with a focus on intuitive design and streamlining user experience. 

# Context
Built as a project after taking a course on C# Windows Applications. Was my first introduction to Visual Studio, which made designing applications incredibly easy due to the ability to drag and drop components to a window. Taught me a lot about event listeners, and also took what I learned from the iOS development class to use the MVC designing scheme.
